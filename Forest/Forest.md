In this example we extend the tree example into a forest, where
each tree is described by a separate graph object and parameters driving the
growth of these trees vary across individuals following a predefined distribution.
This tutorial requires using the Distributions.jl package:

```julia
import Pkg
Pkg.add("Distributions")
Pkg.add("Plots")
```

The data types, rendering methods and growth rules are the same as in the binary
tree example:

```julia
using VPL
using Distributions, Plots
# Data types
module TreeTypes
    import VPL
    # Meristem
    struct Meristem <: VPL.Node end
    # Bud
    struct Bud <: VPL.Node end
    # Node
    struct Node <: VPL.Node end
    # BudNode
    struct BudNode <: VPL.Node end
    # Internode (needs to be mutable to allow for changes over time)
    Base.@kwdef mutable struct Internode <: VPL.Node
        length::Float64 = 0.10 # Internodes start at 10 cm
    end
    # Leaf
    Base.@kwdef struct Leaf <: VPL.Node
        length::Float64 = 0.20 # Leaves are 20 cm long
        width::Float64  = 0.1 # Leaves are 10 cm wide
    end    
    # Graph-level variables
    Base.@kwdef struct treeparams
        growth::Float64 = 0.1   
        budbreak::Float64 = 0.25
        phyllotaxis::Float64 = 140.0
        leaf_angle::Float64 = 30.0
        branch_angle::Float64 = 45.0
    end
end

import .tree

# Create geometry + color for the internodes
function VPL.feed!(turtle::Turtle, i::TreeTypes.Internode, vars)
    # Rotate turtle around the head to implement elliptical phyllotaxis
    rh!(turtle, vars.phyllotaxis) 
    HollowCylinder!(turtle, length = i.length, height = i.length/15, width = i.length/15, 
                move = true, color = RGB(0.5,0.4,0.0))
    return nothing
end

# Create geometry + color for the leaves
function VPL.feed!(turtle::Turtle, l::TreeTypes.Leaf, vars)
    # Rotate turtle around the arm for insertion angle
    ra!(turtle, -vars.leaf_angle)
    # Generate the leaf 
    Ellipse!(turtle, length = l.length, width = l.width, move = false, 
             color = RGB(0.2,0.6,0.2))
    # Rotate turtle back to original direction
    ra!(turtle, vars.leaf_angle)
    return nothing
end

# Insertion angle for the bud nodes
function VPL.feed!(turtle::Turtle, b::TreeTypes.BudNode, vars)
    # Rotate turtle around the arm for insertion angle
    ra!(turtle, -vars.branch_angle)
end


# Rules
meristem_rule = Rule(TreeTypes.Meristem, rhs = mer -> TreeTypes.Node() + 
                                              (TreeTypes.Bud(), TreeTypes.Leaf()) +
                                         TreeTypes.Internode() + TreeTypes.Meristem())

function prob_break(bud)
    # We move to parent node in the branch where the bud was created
    node =  parent(bud)
    # We count the number of internodes between node and the first Meristem 
    # moving down the graph
    check, steps = hasDescendent(node, condition = n -> data(n) isa TreeTypes.Meristem)
    steps = Int(ceil(steps/2)) # Because it will count both the nodes and the internodes
    # Compute probability of bud break and determine whether it happens
    if check
        prob =  min(1.0, steps*vars(bud).budbreak)
        return rand() < prob
    # If there is no meristem, an error happened since the model does not allow for this    
    else
        error("No meristem found in branch")
    end
end
branch_rule = Rule(TreeTypes.Bud, 
            lhs = prob_break, 
            rhs = bud -> TreeTypes.BudNode() + TreeTypes.Internode() + TreeTypes.Meristem())
```

The main difference with respect to the tree is that several of the parameters
will vary per TreeTypes. Also, the location of the tree and initial orientation of 
the turtle will also vary. To achieve this we need to:

(i) Add two additional initial nodes that move the turtle to the starting position
of each tree and rotates it.

(ii) Wrap the axiom, rules and the creation of the graph into a function that 
takes the required parameters as inputs.

```julia
function create_tree(origin, growth, budbreak, orientation)
    axiom = T(origin) + RH(orientation) + TreeTypes.Internode() + TreeTypes.Meristem()
    tree =  Graph(axiom = axiom, rules = (meristem_rule, branch_rule), 
                  vars = TreeTypes.treeparams(growth = growth, budbreak = budbreak))
    return tree
end
```

The code for elongating the internodes to simulate growth remains the same as for
the binary tree example

```julia
getInternode = Query(TreeTypes.Internode)

function elongate!(tree, query)
    for x in apply(tree, query)
        x.length = x.length*(1.0 + vars(tree).growth)
    end
end

function growth!(tree, query)
    elongate!(tree, query)
    rewrite!(tree)
end

function simulate(tree, query, nsteps)
    new_tree = deepcopy(tree)
    for i in 1:nsteps
        growth!(new_tree, query)
    end
    return new_tree
end
```

Let's simulate a forest of 10 x 10 trees with a distance between (and within) rows
of 2 meters. First we generate the original positions of the trees. For the 
position we just need to pass a `Vec` object with the x, y, and z coordinates of 
the location of each TreeTypes. The code below will generate a matrix with the coordinates:

```julia
origins = [Vec(i,j,0) for i = 1:2.0:20.0, j = 1:2.0:20.0]
```

We may assume that the initial orientation is uniformly distributed between 0 and 360 degrees:

```julia
orientations = [rand()*360.0 for i = 1:2.0:20.0, j = 1:2.0:20.0]
```

For the `growth` and `budbreak` parameters we will assumed that they follow a 
LogNormal and Beta distribution, respectively. We can generate random
values from these distributions using the `Distributions` package. For the
relative growth rate:

```julia
growths = rand(LogNormal(-2, 0.3), 10, 10)
histogram(vec(growths))
```

And for the budbreak parameter:

```julia
budbreaks = rand(Beta(2.0, 10), 10, 10)
histogram(vec(budbreaks))
```

Now we can create our forest by calling the `create_tree` function we defined earlier
with the correct inputs per tree:

```julia
forest = vec(create_tree.(origins, growths, budbreaks, orientations));
```

By vectorizing `create_tree()` over the different arrays, we end up with an array
of trees. Each tree is a different Graph, with its own nodes, rewriting rules 
and variables. This avoids having to create a large graphs to include all the 
plants in a simulation. Below we will run a simulation, first using a sequential
approach (i.e. using one core) and then using multiple cores in our computers (please check
https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/multi-threading/ if the different cores are not being used
as you may need to change some settings in your computer).

## Sequential simulation

We can simulate the growth of each tree by applying the method `simulate` to each
tree, creating a new version of the forest (the code below is an array comprehension)

```julia
newforest = [simulate(tree, getInternode, 2) for tree in forest];
```

And we can render the forest with the function `render` as in the binary tree
example but passing the whole forest at once

```julia
render(newforest)
```

If we iterate 4 more iterations we will start seeing the different individuals
diverging in size due to the differences in growth rates

```julia
newforest = [simulate(tree, getInternode, 15) for tree in newforest];
render(newforest)
```

## Multithreaded simulation

In the previous section, the simulation of growth was done sequentially, one tree
after another (since the growth of a tree only depends on its own parameters). However,
this can also be executed in multiple threads. In this case we use an explicit loop 
and execute the iterations of the loop in multiple threads using the macro `@threads`.
Note that the rendering function can also be ran in parallel (i.e. the geometry will be
generated separately for each plant and the merge together):

```julia
using Base.Threads
newforest = deepcopy(forest)
@threads for i in 1:length(forest)
    newforest[i] = simulate(forest[i], getInternode, 6)
end
render(newforest, parallel = true)
```

An alternative way to perform the simulation is to have an outer loop for each timestep and an internal loop over the different trees. Although this approach is not required for this simple model, most FSP models will probably need such a scheme as growth of each individual plant will depend on competition for resources with neighbouring plants. In this case, this approach would look as follows:

```julia
newforest = deepcopy(forest)
for step in 1:15
    @threads for i in 1:length(newforest)
        newforest[i] = simulate(newforest[i], getInternode, 1)
    end
end
render(newforest, parallel = true)
```

# Customizing the scene

Here we are going to customize the scene of our simulation by adding a horizontal tile represting soil and
tweaking the 3D representation. When we want to combine plants generated from graphs with any other
geometric element it is best to combine all these geometries in a `GLScene` object. We can start the scene
with the `newforest` generated in the above:

```julia
scene = Scene(newforest);
```

We can create the soil tile directly, without having to create a graph. The simplest approach is two use 
a special constructor `Rectangle` where one species a corner of the rectangle and two vectors defining the
two sides of the vectors. Both the sides and the corner need to be specified with `Vec` just like in the
above when we determined the origin of each plant. VPL offers some shortcuts: `O()` returns the origin
(`Vec(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)`), whereas `X`, `Y` and `Z` returns the corresponding axes and you can scale them by 
passing the desired length as input. Below, a rectangle is created on the XY plane with the origin as a 
corner and each side being 11 units long:

```julia
soil = Rectangle(length = 21.0, width = 21.0)
rotatey!(soil, pi/2)
VPL.translate!(soil, Vec(0.0, 10.5, 0.0))
```

We can now add the `soil` to the `scene` object with the `add!` function.
```julia
VPL.add!(scene, mesh = soil, color = RGB(1,1,0))
```

We can now render the scene that combines the random forest of binary trees and a yellow soil. Notice that
in all previous figures, a coordinate system with grids was being depicted. This is helpful for debugging
your code but also to help setup the scene (e.g. if you are not sure how big the soil tile should be).
Howver, it may be distracting for the visualization. It turns out that we can turn that off with
`show_axes = false`:

```julia
render(scene, axes = false)
```

We may also want to save a screenshot of the scene. For this, we need to store the output of the `render` function.
We can then resize the window rendering the scene, move around, zoom, etc. When we have a perspective that we like,
we can run the `save_scene` function on the object returned from `render`. The argument `resolution` can be adjusted in both
`render` to increase the number of pixels in the final image. A helper function `calculate_resolution` is provided to 
compute the resolution from a physical width and height in cm and a dpi (e.g., useful for publications and posters):

```julia

res = calculate_resolution(width = 16.0, height = 16.0, dpi = 1_000)
output = render(scene, axes = false, resolution = res)
export_scene(scene = output, filename = "nice_trees.png") 
```
