In this example we extend the binary forest example to have more complex, time-
dependent development and growth based on carbon allocation. For simplicity, the
model assumes a constant relative growth rate at the plant level to compute the
biomass increment. In the next example this assumption is relaxed by a model of
radiation use efficiency. When modelling growth from carbon allocation, the
biomass of each organ is then translated in to an area or volume and the
dimensions of the organs are updated accordingly (assuming a particular shape).

The following packages are needed:

```julia
using VirtualPlantLab, ColorTypes
using Base.Threads: @threads
using Plots
import Random
using FastGaussQuadrature
using Distributions
Random.seed!(123456789)
```

## Model definition

### Node types

The data types needed to simulate the trees are given in the following
module. The differences with respect to the previous example are:

    - Meristems do not produce phytomers every day
    - A relative sink strength approach is used to allocate biomass to organs
    - The geometry of the organs is updated based on the new biomass
    - Bud break probability is a function of distance to apical meristem

```julia
# Data types
module TreeTypes
    using VirtualPlantLab
    using Distributions
    # Meristem
    Base.@kwdef mutable struct Meristem <: VirtualPlantLab.Node
        age::Int64 = 0   # Age of the meristem
    end
    # Bud
    struct Bud <: VirtualPlantLab.Node end
    # Node
    struct Node <: VirtualPlantLab.Node end
    # BudNode
    struct BudNode <: VirtualPlantLab.Node end
    # Internode (needs to be mutable to allow for changes over time)
    Base.@kwdef mutable struct Internode <: VirtualPlantLab.Node
        age::Int64 = 0         # Age of the internode
        biomass::Float64 = 0.0 # Initial biomass
        length::Float64 = 0.0  # Internodes
        width::Float64  = 0.0  # Internodes
        sink::Exponential{Float64} = Exponential(5)
    end
    # Leaf
    Base.@kwdef mutable struct Leaf <: VirtualPlantLab.Node
        age::Int64 = 0         # Age of the leaf
        biomass::Float64 = 0.0 # Initial biomass
        length::Float64 = 0.0  # Leaves
        width::Float64 = 0.0   # Leaves
        sink::Beta{Float64} = Beta(2,5)
    end
    # Graph-level variables -> mutable because we need to modify them during growth
    Base.@kwdef mutable struct treeparams
        # Variables
        biomass::Float64 = 2e-3 # Current total biomass (g)
        # Parameters
        RGR::Float64 = 1.0   # Relative growth rate (1/d)
        IB0::Float64 = 1e-3  # Initial biomass of an internode (g)
        SIW::Float64 = 0.1e6   # Specific internode weight (g/m3)
        IS::Float64  = 15.0  # Internode shape parameter (length/width)
        LB0::Float64 = 1e-3  # Initial biomass of a leaf
        SLW::Float64 = 100.0 # Specific leaf weight (g/m2)
        LS::Float64  = 3.0   # Leaf shape parameter (length/width)
        budbreak::Float64 = 1/0.5 # Bud break probability coefficient (in 1/m)
        plastochron::Int64 = 5 # Number of days between phytomer production
        leaf_expansion::Float64 = 15.0 # Number of days that a leaf expands
        phyllotaxis::Float64 = 140.0
        leaf_angle::Float64 = 30.0
        branch_angle::Float64 = 45.0
    end
end

import .TreeTypes
```

### Geometry

The methods for creating the geometry and color of the tree are the same as in
the previous example.

```julia
# Create geometry + color for the internodes
function VirtualPlantLab.feed!(turtle::Turtle, i::TreeTypes.Internode, vars)
    # Rotate turtle around the head to implement elliptical phyllotaxis
    rh!(turtle, vars.phyllotaxis)
    HollowCylinder!(turtle, length = i.length, height = i.width, width = i.width,
                move = true, color = RGB(0.5,0.4,0.0))
    return nothing
end

# Create geometry + color for the leaves
function VirtualPlantLab.feed!(turtle::Turtle, l::TreeTypes.Leaf, vars)
    # Rotate turtle around the arm for insertion angle
    ra!(turtle, -vars.leaf_angle)
    # Generate the leaf
    Ellipse!(turtle, length = l.length, width = l.width, move = false,
             color = RGB(0.2,0.6,0.2))
    # Rotate turtle back to original direction
    ra!(turtle, vars.leaf_angle)
    return nothing
end

# Insertion angle for the bud nodes
function VirtualPlantLab.feed!(turtle::Turtle, b::TreeTypes.BudNode, vars)
    # Rotate turtle around the arm for insertion angle
    ra!(turtle, -vars.branch_angle)
end
```

### Development

The meristem rule is now parameterized by the initial states of the leaves and
internodes and will only be triggered every X days where X is the plastochron.

```julia
# Create right side of the growth rule (parameterized by the initial states
# of the leaves and internodes)
function create_meristem_rule(vleaf, vint)
    meristem_rule = Rule(TreeTypes.Meristem,
                        lhs = mer -> mod(data(mer).age, graph_data(mer).plastochron) == 0,
                        rhs = mer -> TreeTypes.Node() +
                                     (TreeTypes.Bud(),
                                     TreeTypes.Leaf(biomass = vleaf.biomass,
                                                    length  = vleaf.length,
                                                    width   = vleaf.width)) +
                                     TreeTypes.Internode(biomass = vint.biomass,
                                                         length  = vint.length,
                                                         width   = vint.width) +
                                     TreeTypes.Meristem())
end
```

The bud break probability is now a function of distance to the apical meristem
rather than the number of internodes. An adhoc traversal is used to compute this
length of the main branch a bud belongs to (ignoring the lateral branches).

```julia
# Compute the probability that a bud breaks as function of distance to the meristem
function prob_break(bud)
    # We move to parent node in the branch where the bud was created
    node =  parent(bud)
    # Extract the first internode
    child = filter(x -> data(x) isa TreeTypes.Internode, children(node))[1]
    data_child = data(child)
    # We measure the length of the branch until we find the meristem
    distance = 0.0
    while !isa(data_child, TreeTypes.Meristem)
        # If we encounter an internode, store the length and move to the next node
        if data_child isa TreeTypes.Internode
            distance += data_child.length
            child = children(child)[1]
            data_child = data(child)
        # If we encounter a node, extract the next internode
        elseif data_child isa TreeTypes.Node
                child = filter(x -> data(x) isa TreeTypes.Internode, children(child))[1]
                data_child = data(child)
        else
            error("Should be Internode, Node or Meristem")
        end
    end
    # Compute the probability of bud break as function of distance and
    # make stochastic decision
    prob =  min(1.0, distance*graph_data(bud).budbreak)
    return rand() < prob
end

# Branch rule parameterized by initial states of internodes
function create_branch_rule(vint)
    branch_rule = Rule(TreeTypes.Bud,
            lhs = prob_break,
            rhs = bud -> TreeTypes.BudNode() +
                         TreeTypes.Internode(biomass = vint.biomass,
                                             length  = vint.length,
                                             width   = vint.width) +
                         TreeTypes.Meristem())
end
```


### Growth

We need some functions to compute the length and width of a leaf or internode
from its biomass

```julia
function leaf_dims(biomass, vars)
    leaf_biomass = biomass
    leaf_area    = biomass/vars.SLW
    leaf_length  = sqrt(leaf_area*4*vars.LS/pi)
    leaf_width   = leaf_length/vars.LS
    return leaf_length, leaf_width
end

function int_dims(biomass, vars)
    int_biomass = biomass
    int_volume  = biomass/vars.SIW
    int_length  = cbrt(int_volume*4*vars.IS^2/pi)
    int_width   = int_length/vars.IS
    return int_length, int_width
end
```

Each day, the total biomass of the tree is updated using a simple RGR formula
and the increment of biomass is distributed across the organs proportionally to
their relative sink strength (of leaves or internodes).

The sink strength of leaves is modelled with a beta distribution scaled to the
`leaf_expansion` argument that determines the duration of leaf growth, whereas
for the internodes it follows a negative exponential distribution. The `pdf`
function computes the probability density of each distribution which is taken as
proportional to the sink strength (the model is actually source-limited since we
imposed a particular growth rate).

```julia
sink_strength(leaf, vars) = leaf.age > vars.leaf_expansion ? 0.0 :
                            pdf(leaf.sink, leaf.age/vars.leaf_expansion)/100.0
plot(0:1:50, x -> sink_strength(TreeTypes.Leaf(age = x), TreeTypes.treeparams()),
     xlabel = "Age", ylabel = "Sink strength", label = "Leaf")
```

```julia
sink_strength(int) = pdf(int.sink, int.age)
plot!(0:1:50, x -> sink_strength(TreeTypes.Internode(age = x)), label = "Internode")
```

Now we need a function that updates the biomass of the tree, allocates it to the
different organs and updates the dimensions of said organs. For simplicity,
we create the functions `leaves()` and `internodes()` that will apply the queries
to the tree required to extract said nodes:

```julia
get_leaves(tree) = apply(tree, Query(TreeTypes.Leaf))
get_internodes(tree) = apply(tree, Query(TreeTypes.Internode))
```

The age of the different organs is updated every time step:

```julia
function age!(all_leaves, all_internodes, all_meristems)
    for leaf in all_leaves
        leaf.age += 1
    end
    for int in all_internodes
        int.age += 1
    end
    for mer in all_meristems
        mer.age += 1
    end
    return nothing
end
```

The daily growth is allocated to different organs proportional to their sink
strength.

```julia
function grow!(tree, all_leaves, all_internodes)
    # Compute total biomass increment
    tvars = data(tree)
    ΔB    = tvars.RGR*tvars.biomass
    tvars.biomass += ΔB
    # Total sink strength
    total_sink = 0.0
    for leaf in all_leaves
        total_sink += sink_strength(leaf, tvars)
    end
    for int in all_internodes
        total_sink += sink_strength(int)
    end
    # Allocate biomass to leaves and internodes
    for leaf in all_leaves
        leaf.biomass += ΔB*sink_strength(leaf, tvars)/total_sink
    end
    for int in all_internodes
        int.biomass += ΔB*sink_strength(int)/total_sink
    end
    return nothing
end
```

Finally, we need to update the dimensions of the organs. The leaf dimensions are

```julia
function size_leaves!(all_leaves, tvars)
    for leaf in all_leaves
        leaf.length, leaf.width = leaf_dims(leaf.biomass, tvars)
    end
    return nothing
end
function size_internodes!(all_internodes, tvars)
    for int in all_internodes
        int.length, int.width = int_dims(int.biomass, tvars)
    end
    return nothing
end
```

### Daily step

All the growth and developmental functions are combined together into a daily
step function that updates the forest by iterating over the different trees in
parallel.

```julia
get_meristems(tree) = apply(tree, Query(TreeTypes.Meristem))
function daily_step!(forest)
    @threads for tree in forest
        # Retrieve all the relevant organs
        all_leaves = get_leaves(tree)
        all_internodes = get_internodes(tree)
        all_meristems = get_meristems(tree)
        # Update the age of the organs
        age!(all_leaves, all_internodes, all_meristems)
        # Grow the tree
        grow!(tree, all_leaves, all_internodes)
        tvars = data(tree)
        size_leaves!(all_leaves, tvars)
        size_internodes!(all_internodes, tvars)
        # Developmental rules
        rewrite!(tree)
    end
end
```

### Initialization

The trees are initialized in a regular grid with random values for the initial
orientation and RGR:

```julia
RGRs = rand(Normal(0.3,0.01), 10, 10)
histogram(vec(RGRs))
```

```julia
orientations = [rand()*360.0 for i = 1:2.0:20.0, j = 1:2.0:20.0]
histogram(vec(orientations))
```

```julia
origins = [Vec(i,j,0) for i = 1:2.0:20.0, j = 1:2.0:20.0];
```

The following initalizes a tree based on the origin, orientation and RGR:

```julia
function create_tree(origin, orientation, RGR)
    # Initial state and parameters of the tree
    vars = TreeTypes.treeparams(RGR = RGR)
    # Initial states of the leaves
    leaf_length, leaf_width = leaf_dims(vars.LB0, vars)
    vleaf = (biomass = vars.LB0, length = leaf_length, width = leaf_width)
    # Initial states of the internodes
    int_length, int_width = int_dims(vars.LB0, vars)
    vint = (biomass = vars.IB0, length = int_length, width = int_width)
    # Growth rules
    meristem_rule = create_meristem_rule(vleaf, vint)
    branch_rule   = create_branch_rule(vint)
    axiom = T(origin) + RH(orientation) +
            TreeTypes.Internode(biomass = vint.biomass,
                             length  = vint.length,
                             width   = vint.width) +
            TreeTypes.Meristem()
    tree = Graph(axiom = axiom, rules = (meristem_rule, branch_rule),
                 data = vars)
    return tree
end
```


## Visualization

As in the previous example, it makes sense to visualize the forest with a soil
tile beneath it. Unlike in the previous example, we will construct the soil tile
using a dedicated graph and generate a `Scene` object which can later be
merged with the rest of scene generated in daily step:

```julia
Base.@kwdef struct Soil <: VirtualPlantLab.Node
    length::Float64
    width::Float64
end
function VirtualPlantLab.feed!(turtle::Turtle, s::Soil, vars)
    Rectangle!(turtle, length = s.length, width = s.width, color = RGB(255/255, 236/255, 179/255))
end
soil_graph = RA(-90.0) + T(Vec(0.0, 10.0, 0.0)) + # Moves into position
             Soil(length = 20.0, width = 20.0) # Draws the soil tile
soil = Scene(Graph(axiom = soil_graph));
render(soil, axes = false)
```

And the following function renders the entire scene (notice that we need to
use `display()` to force the rendering of the scene when called within a loop
or a function):

```julia
function render_forest(forest, soil)
    scene = Scene(vec(forest)) # create scene from forest
    scene = Scene([scene, soil]) # merges the two scenes
    render(scene)
end
```


## Retrieving canopy-level data

We may want to extract some information at the canopy level such as LAI. This is
best achieved with a query:

```julia
function get_LAI(forest)
    LAI = 0.0
    @threads for tree in forest
        for leaf in get_leaves(tree)
            LAI += leaf.length*leaf.width*pi/4.0
        end
    end
    return LAI/400.0
end
```

## Simulation

We can now create a forest of trees on a regular grid:

```julia
forest = create_tree.(origins, orientations, RGRs);
render_forest(forest, soil)
for i in 1:50
    daily_step!(forest)
end
render_forest(forest, soil)
```

And compute the leaf area index:

```julia
get_LAI(forest)
```
