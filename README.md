# VPLTutorials

Collection of tutorials for [VPL](https://virtualplantlab.com/dev/). Each tutorial is given
in three different formats:

- As a Julia source file (`script`) without any comments.

- As a markdown file (`markdown`). VS Code may be used to render it but also execute the code in each cell if the Julia extension is installed.

- As a Jupyter notebook (`notebook`). These may be used with the package IJulia.
-
In addition to VirtualPlantLab.jl, some of the tutorials may require the following packages:

- [SkyDomes.jl](https://github.com/VirtualPlantLab/SkyDomes.jl)
- [Ecophys.jl](https://github.com/VirtualPlantLab/Ecophys.jl)
