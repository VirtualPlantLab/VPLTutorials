In this first example, we learn how to create a `Graph` and update it
dynamically with rewriting rules.

The model described here is based on the non-branching model of [algae
growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system#Example_1:_Algae) proposed by
Lindermayer as one of the first L-systems.

First, we need to load the VPL metapackage, which will automatically load all
the packages in the VPL ecosystem.

```julia
using VirtualPlantLab
```

The rewriting rules of the L-system are as follows:

**axiom**:   A

**rule 1**:  A $\rightarrow$ AB

**rule 2**:  B $\rightarrow$ A

In VPL, this L-system would be implemented as a graph where the nodes can be of
type `A` or `B` and inherit from the abstract type `Node`. It is advised to
include type definitions in a module to avoid having to restart the Julia
session whenever we want to redefine them. Because each module is an independent
namespace, we need to import `Node` from the VPL package inside the module:

```julia
module algae
    import VirtualPlantLab: Node
    struct A <: Node end
    struct B <: Node end
end
import .algae
```

Note that in this very example we do not need to store any data or state inside
the nodes, so types `A` and `B` do not require fields.

The axiom is simply defined as an instance of type of `A`:

```julia
axiom = algae.A()
```

The rewriting rules are implemented in VPL as objects of type `Rule`. In VPL, a
rewriting rule substitutes a node in a graph with a new node or subgraph and is
therefore composed of two parts:

1. A condition that is tested against each node in a graph to choose which nodes
   to rewrite.
2. A subgraph that will replace each node selected by the condition above.

In VPL, the condition is split into two components:

1. The type of node to be selected (in this example that would be `A` or `B`).
2. A function that is applied to each node in the graph (of the specified type)
   to indicate whether the node should be selected or not. This function is
   optional (the default is to select every node of the specified type).

The replacement subgraph is specified by a function that takes as input the node
selected and returns a subgraph defined as a combination of node objects.
Subgraphs (which can also be used as axioms) are created by linearly combining
objects that inherit from `Node`. The operation `+` implies a linear
relationship between two nodes and `[]` indicates branching.

The implementation of the two rules of algae growth model in VPL is as follows:

```julia
rule1 = Rule(algae.A, rhs = x -> algae.A() + algae.B())
rule2 = Rule(algae.B, rhs = x -> algae.A())
```

Note that in each case, the argument `rhs` is being assigned an anonymous (aka
*lambda*) function. This is a function without a name that is defined directly
in the assignment to the argument. That is, the Julia expression `x -> A() + B()`
is equivalent to the following function definition:

```julia
function rule_1(x)
    algae.A() + algae.B()
end
```

For simple rules (especially if the right-hand side is just a line of code) it
is easier to just define the right-hand side of the rule with an anonymous
function rather than creating a standalone function with a meaningful name.
However, standalone functions are easier to debug as you can call them directly
from the REPL.

With the axiom and rules we can now create a `Graph` object that represents the
algae organism. The first argument is the axiom and the second is a tuple with
all the rewriting rules:

```julia
organism = Graph(axiom = axiom, rules = (rule1, rule2))
```

If we apply the rewriting rules iteratively, the graph will grow, in this case
representing the growth of the algae organism. The rewriting rules are applied
on the graph with the function `rewrite!()`:

```julia
rewrite!(organism)
```

Since there was only one node of type `A`, the only rule that was applied was
`rule1`, so the graph should now have two nodes of types `A` and `B`,
respectively. We can confirm this by drawing the graph. We do this with the
function `draw()` which will always generate the same representation of the
graph, but different options are available depending on the context where the
code is executed. By default, `draw()` will create a new window where an
interactive version of the graph will be drawn and one can zoom and pan with the
mouse (in this online document a static version is shown, see
[Backends](../../manual/Visualization.md) for details):

```julia
import GLMakie
draw(organism)
```

Notice that each node in the network representation is labelled with the type of
node (`A` or `B` in this case) and a number in parentheses. This number is a
unique identifier associated to each node, and it is useful for debugging
purposes (this will be explained in more advanced examples).

Applying multiple iterations of rewriting can be achieved with a simple loop:

```julia
for i in 1:4
    rewrite!(organism)
end
```

And we can verify that the graph grew as expected:

```julia
draw(organism)
```

The network is rather boring as the system is growing linearly (no branching)
but it already illustrates how graphs can grow rapidly in just a few iterations.
Remember that the interactive visualization allows adjusting the zoom, which is
handy when graphs become large.
