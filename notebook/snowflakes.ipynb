    "In this example, we create a Koch snowflake, which is one of the earliest\n",
    "fractals to be described. The Koch snowflake is a closed curve composed on\n",
    "multiple of segments of different lengths. Starting with an equilateral\n",
    "triangle, each segment in the snowflake is replaced by four segments of smaller\n",
    "length arrange in a specific manner. Graphically, the first four iterations of\n",
    "the Koch snowflake construction process result in the following figures (the\n",
    "green segments are shown as guides but they are not part of the snowflake):\n",

    "In order to implement the construction process of a Koch snowflake in VPL we\n",
    "need to understand how a 3D structure can be generated from a graph of nodes.\n",
    "VPL uses a procedural approach to generate of structure based on the concept of\n",
    "turtle graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this approach is to imagine a turtle located in space with a\n",
    "particular position and orientation. The turtle then starts consuming the\n",
    "different nodes in the graph (following its topological structure) and generates\n",
    "3D structures as defined by the user for each type of node. The consumption of a\n",
    "node may also include instructions to move and/or rotate the turtle, which\n",
    "allows to alter the relative position of the different 3D structures described\n",
    "by a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The construction process of the Koch snowflake in VPL could then be represented\n",
    "by the following axiom and rewriting rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "axiom: E(L) + RU(120) + E(L) + RU(120) + E(L)\n",
    "rule:  E(L) â†’ E(L/3) + RU(-60) + E(L/3) + RU(120) + E(L/3) + RU(-60) + E(L/3)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where E represent and edge of a given length (given in parenthesis) and RU\n",
    "represents a rotation of the turtle around the upward axis, with angle of\n",
    "rotation given in parenthesis in hexadecimal degrees. The rule can be visualized\n",
    "as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Koch construction rule](https://python-with-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/koch_order_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that VPL already provides several classes for common turtle movements and\n",
    "rotations, so our implementation of the Koch snowflake only needs to define a\n",
    "class to implement the edges of the snowflake. This can be achieved as follows:"
